The module provides the following option to deal with GSS API name attributes:

#### GssapiNameAttributes

Enables the module to source Name Attributes from the client name
(authorization data associated with the established context) and exposes them
as environment variables.

Value format: ENV_VAR_NAME ATTRIBUTE_NAME

This option can be specified multiple times, once for each attribute to expose.
The Special value "json" is used to expose all attributes in a json formatted
string via the special environment variable GSS_NAME_ATTRS_JSON
The environment variable GSS_NAME_ATTR_ERROR is set with the Gssapi returned
error string in case the inquire name function fails to retrieve attributes,
and with the string "0 attributes found", if no attributes are set.

#### Example
    GssapiNameAttributes json
    GssapiNameAttributes RADIUS_USER_NAME urn:ietf:params:gss:radius-attribute 1
    GssapiNameAttributes EPPN urn:ietf:params:gss:federated-saml-attribute urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6

#### Feedback on authentication failure reason

In addition to this, in the event of an authentication failure,
 the module exports an environment variable called MAG_ERROR wich contains one 
of the following values:
* "NO_AUTH_DATA" when the client did not send any authentication data (usually because the
 appropriate libraries are not installed on the browser).
* "UNSUP_AUTH_TYPE" when the client sent authentication data of an invalid type.
* "GSS_MECH_ERROR" when the GSS mechanism failed for some reason (e.g. invalid credentials). 

In addition to this, whenever MAG_ERROR takes a value of "GSS_MECH_ERROR", an additional environment
variable named GSS_ERROR_STR is sourced. This variable contains the result of
the gss_display_status() call and may help web developers to show a more appropriate error page/string
to the user.
