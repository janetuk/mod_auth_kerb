- Save Creds/Tickets
	Retrieve and store krbtgt and set env variable of file path.

- Cleanup Daemon
	Maybe write some little cleanup daemon to clean up ticket files.

- Set Path for Storage of Temp Files
	Storage of ticket files, and maybe others at some point.

- Verify Krb5 Ticket
	Currently www/hostname.
	Can I do this with Krb4?

- Ability to Set Realm in Config
	Not compiled in anymore.
	Maybe some form of multiple realms specifiable?

- Settable Location of Keytab/Srvtab
	Again, in config instead of compiled in.

- Authoritative Support
	If Kerberos check fails, don't fall through to other modules.
	Should I used AuthAuthoritative for this or a specific Kerb one?

- Lifetime Settable
	Set lifetime of tickets in config.

- Default Instance
	You can make it so that 'by default', a user's daniel/root or 
	daniel/www instance is auth'd against instead of just daniel.

- Any Instance
	Allow for specification of daniel/root or daniel/admin.
	If off, only checks against defaultinstance instance.

- Expire Reauth
	Set a lifetime on tickets, and after expiration, tries to -force-
	a reauth (brings up login/password window)

- Auth Fail Status
	Set how a failure fails.  Forbidden or Unauthorized.

- Forwardable/Renewable Tickets
	Setting in config.

- Browser Mutual Auth Support
	Combined with plugins, use auth user already has.

- AuthKerberosType(name?)
	Way to both have a normal AuthType and a Kerberos authtype,
	in case you want to turn authoritative off and have it punt
	to something else specific
